> *"The world below water is not bright and sunny like that of dry land. Still, whenever I lend myself to the deep, my heart gradually fills with a permeating sense of peace. Fish move in faraway shoals, jellyfish dance around me, and my troubles start to simply wash away. Mmm... I could take you to see it sometime, what do you think?"*

*Cute and comfy theme inspired by the colors of Sangonomiya Kokomi and Watatsumi Island, from Genshin Impact!*
